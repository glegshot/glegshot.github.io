<i>"What's the difference between a string literal and a new String Object in Java?"</i>
</p>

<p>
This is a common question every Java programmer has come across in their programming life.
</p>

<p>
To answer in short, the literals are stored in a special memory area in the heap called Stringpool, and each String value is unique in the pool.<br>
So irrespective of one or more declarations of variables with the same String value in the code, only one object will be created in the pool.<br>
Whereas the new operator will create a different object each time we invoke it, even if the String value is the same.
</p>

<p>
While we can verify this programmatically by object comparison leveraging the hashcode, I was curious to verify this from the memory perspective.<br>
So I quickly created the below snippet of code:
</p>

<div class="code-section">
<code>
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;String wordOne = "Hello"; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;String wordTwo = "Hello"; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread.sleep(100000); <br>
}
</code>
</div>

</p>
The sleep statement was created to just have enough time to capture the heap before it terminates.
</p>

</p>
While the code was executing, we fired up VisualVM to capture the heap memory state of the process.
</p>

</p>
VisualVM is a free piece of software that can be used to create heap dumps (and many more) and also inspect them.
</p>

<p>
Once the dump was created, I ran the below OQL query to filter out the specific instance I was interested in.
</p>

<div class="code-section">
<code>
select s from java.lang.String s where s.toString().equals("Hello");
</code>
</div>

</p>
It gave me only one instance of String class, indicating both variables are pointing to the same object in memory.(Figure 1)
</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1: Only one reference of the String object with reference ID 808 and with value "Hello"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Now we executed the below code:
</p>

<div class="code-section">
<code>
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;String wordOne = new String("Hello");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;String wordTwo = new String("Hello");<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Thread.sleep(100000);<br>

}
</code>
</div>

<p>
This gave me three instances in the result set with different object IDs, as seen in the snapshot.(Figure 2)
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../assets/cases/j2/objectsnap.PNG" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: Three references of the String object with value "Hello"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Now you may ask, <i>Why three IDs? Why was it not two as per the expectation?</i>
</p>

<p>
Because when we initialized the String object, we passed a literal value into the constructor, <br>
and this literal was stored in the stringpool as an object.<br>
Hence, three String objects
</p>

<p>
This shows that the literal values are reused and the string objects are created each time the new operator is used.

</p>

<p>
It was fun experimenting with the theory using heapdump, and I urge everyone to explore this as well.
</p>

<p>
Keep practicing and keep growing. <br>
Thank you everyone.
